- Add token icon in png format to the `icons` folder as a backup image
- Add your token information to `zksync.json` at the bottom of the list while using the url of your icon image from coingecko e.g. `https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2518/small/weth.png?1628852295`. Please follow the current format. We will not pull assets that are not on coingecko.
